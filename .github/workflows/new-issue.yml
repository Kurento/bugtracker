            Hello @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}! :wave: we're sorry you
            found a bug... so first of all, thank you very much for reporting
            it.


            However, **your report doesn't follow the [issue template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kurento/bugtracker/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)**,
            so it is being automatically closed. We are really sorry for that,
            but we need all reports to follow the template, or else it won't be
            possible to understand and help with all issues.


            Please, create a new issue following the template, or reopen this
            same issue to edit and provide all required information.
