* Be precise: don’t wander around and go straight to the point, describing as
  precisely as possible what’s happening

* Be clear: explain how to reproduce the problem, step by step, so others can
  reproduce the bug

* Be economic: provide the minimum amount of information needed to understand
  what’s happening

* Be clean: report only one problem per issue so we can track individual
  issues

* Be curious: has it been asked before? is it really a bug? Google is your
  friend!

* Be provactive: Check with other versions, speacially with the latest
  develeopment version. We can't emphasize this enough: it's the
  first thing that we are going to ask
